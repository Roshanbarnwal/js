        <p>div.innerText="" will first bring the div's value then overwrite it. So, 2 steps</p>
        <p>But document.createTextNode("") will create a new content. 1 step. Then, it is appended. So, 2 steps. </p>
        <p>So, both should be discussed in terms of optimization</p><br>
        <p>appendChild traverses to the end of node/tree. Not efficient.Maybe.</p>

Github Codespaces (aka github.dev) creates a virtual space for your repository so you can edit and 
commit your files. It's really just a remote instance of VSCode but it doesn't by default serve your 
files on an endpoint URL.

The good news is, because it's a virtual space (located somewhere on GitHub servers) you can run 
any command like you'd do on your local machine.
That means yeah you can run a server there, and it's smart enough to know you've just run a server and 
does "port forwarding" for you (again it means that you can access this server remotely as you would in 
a localhost development scenario.)

Here's a simple solution:

Open the terminal if not already opened (ctrl+shift+p to open the command palette, and then type 
"toggle terminal" and Enter to select)
Type 'npm i -g http-server' in the newly opened terminal (this will install the tool to easily create 
a server) 
Next, you have to run the server, type ' http-server ' in the same terminal.
You'll then be prompted with a notification.You can click ' Open in Browser '
